it increases the ~~risks~~ of everything from the ~~comming~~ cold to cardio ~~vascule~~ ~~diseass~~
~~basicly~~ i've ~~turn~~ stress into the enemy
but i've changed my mind about the stress
and today i wanna change yours

#### WHAT I WROTE

let me start with a study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress
this study tracked thirty thousands ~~adult~~  in united states for eight years
and ~~it~~ started by asking people how much stress ~~do~~ you ~~expreince~~ in the last year

they also asked do you believe that strees is harmful for your health
and then they used public death ~~record~~ to find out who died ?

### WHAT IT SHOULD BE
let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress.
this study tracked 30,000 __adults__ in the united states for eight years,
and __they__ started by asking people, how much stress __have__ you __experinced__ in the last year?
they also asked, do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?
and then they used public death __records__ to find out who died.

#### WHAT I WROTE

some bad news first, people who ~~exprienced~~ a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent ~~increase~~ risk of ~~diying~~
but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health
people who exprienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die 
in fact they had the lowest risk of ~~diying~~ of anyone in the study including people who ~~have~~ ~~releatively~~
little stress.

#### WHAT I WROTE

the resarchers estimated over the 8 years they were tracking ~~dots~~
one hundered and eighty two thousands americans died ~~permechinly~~  not from stress but from the believe that stress is bad for you 
that is over twenty thousands death a year 
now if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you 
the ~~fiftyth~~ largest cause of death in the united states last year.


#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE 

Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking __deaths__,
182,000 americans died __prematurely__,not from stress, but from belif that stress is bad for you. 
that is over 20,000 death__s__ a year. 
Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress bad for you
the __15th__ largest cause of death in united states last year,
