~~basicly~~ i've ~~turn~~ stress into the enemy
but i've changed my mind about the stress
and today i wanna change yours

#### WHAT I WROTE

let me start with a study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress
this study tracked thirty thousands ~~adult~~  in united states for eight years
and ~~it~~ started by asking people how much stress ~~do~~ you ~~expreince~~ in the last year

they also asked do you believe that strees is harmful for your health
and then they used public death ~~record~~ to find out who died ?

### WHAT IT SHOULD BE
let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress.
this study tracked 30,000 __adults__ in the united states for eight years,
and __they__ started by asking people, how much stress __have__ you __experinced__ in the last year?
they also asked, do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?
and then they used public death __records__ to find out who died.

#### WHAT I WROTE

some bad news first, people who ~~exprienced~~ a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent ~~increase~~ risk of ~~diying~~
but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health
people who exprienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die 
in fact they had the lowest risk of ~~diying~~ of anyone in the study including people who ~~have~~ ~~releatively~~
little stress.

#### WHAT I WROTE

the resarchers estimated over the 8 years they were tracking ~~dots~~
one hundered and eighty two thousands americans died ~~permechinly~~  not from stress but from the believe that stress is bad for you 
that is over twenty thousands death a year 
now if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you 
the ~~fiftyth~~ largest cause of death in the united states last year.


#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE 

Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking __deaths__,
182,000 americans died __prematurely__,not from stress, but from belif that stress is bad for you. 
that is over 20,000 death__s__ a year. 
Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress bad for you
the __15th__ largest cause of death in united states last year,

killing more people than skin cancer,HIV,Aids and ~~homocide~~
you can see why the study freaked me out
here i've been speending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health
so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier.
and here the science says yes
when you change your mind about stress you can change your body's response to ~~the~~ stress.

now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participant in a study
designed to stress you out its called the social stress test
you come in to ~~labratory~~ and you are told you have to give five minutes ~~in prompt to~~ speech

on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluator sitting right in front of you
and to make sure ~~you~~ feel presuare there are bright lights and a camera on your face kinda like this

#### WHAT I WROTE

and the evaluators have been trained to give you ~~disgarenging~~ ~~non-verbing~~ feedback, like this 
now, you ~~sicinfenlty~~ ~~the morolized~~
time for part two a math test,and ~~unbenounce~~ to you the ~~experimental~~ has been trained to ~~eharuse~~ you during it.

### [05:00]

### [05:00]

#### WHAT I WROTE

you are not very good at this,are you?
okay,so you get the idea
now you ~~are~~ actually in the study
you probably be a little stress out
your heart ~~maybe~~ pounding you might breathing faster maybe breaking out into a ~~sweet~~
normally we interpret ~~this~~ physical changes as anxity or signs that we are ~~couping(?)~~ very well with the pressure
but what if you view them ~~instand~~ as signs that your body was energized was ~~prepearing~~ you to meet this challenge

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE

You'are not very good at this, are you?
okay, so you get the idea
if you __were__ actually in this study
you __had__ probably be a little stress__ed__ out
your heart __might__ be pounding you might __be__ breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a __sweat__.
and normally we interpret __these__ physical changes as anxiety or signs that we are __not__ __coping__ very well with the pressure.
but what if you view__ed__ them __instead__ as signs that your body was energized, was __preparing__ you to meet this challenge ?

### [05:30]

### [05:30]

#### WHAT I WROTE

and that is exactly what participents were told in a study conducted ~~in the~~ harward university

before they went through the social stress test they were ~~thought~~ to rethink their stress response was helpful~~l~~.
that pounding heart is preparing you for action  if you breathing faster it's no problem it's getting more oxygen to your brain
and participents who learnt to view the stress response as helpfull for their performance 
they were less stressed out and less ~~anxiess~~ and more confident
but the most ~~fastinating~~ finding to me was how their phisycal response changed

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE

now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted __at__ Harvard University

before they went through the social stress test, they were __taught__ to rethink their stress response as helpful.
that pounding heart is preparing you for action if you breathing faster, it's no problem. it's getting more oxygen to your brain.
and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance,
well, they were less stressed out,less __anxious__, more confident,
but the most __fascinating__ finding to me was how their physical __stress__ response changed .
### [06:5]

#### WHAT I WROTE

now the typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood veseles can stretched like this
this is one of the reasons that can stress sometimes assosicate with cardio vascular dissease its not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
but in the study one participants view thier stress response as helpful 
thier blood veseles stayed relaxed like this 

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [06:30]

#### WHAT I WROTE

thier heart stil pounding but this is a much healthier cardio vascular profile 
it actualy looks like what happens in moments of joy and courage
over a life time full stress experinces this one biological change could be the diffrence between the stress reduces heart attack in age of 50 and living well into your 90s.
and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters.

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE


### [07:02]

#### WHAT I WROTE

so my goal as social psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid off your stress i want to make you better at stress.
and we just did a little intervention
if you raised your hand and said you've had a lot of stress in the last year
we could say we relived
because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself this is my body helping me raised this challenge. 


#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE


### [07:32]   

#### WHAT I WROTE

when you view stress in that way your body belives you and your stress response become healthier
now i said i have over decades of demonizing stress to redeem myself from
so we're going to do one more intervintion 
i want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response
and the idea is this
stress makes you social

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE


### [08:00]

### WHAT I WROTE

to understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormon "oxytocin"
and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a horman can get
it even has it's cute nick name the cuttle(?) hormone 
because it released when you hug someone
but, this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in
oxytocin is a neurohormone 
if i tuned your brain social instinct
it primes you to do things that strengthen your close relation ships.
oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family


### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [08:30]

#### WHAT I WROTE

it enhances your empathy
it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about
some people even suggested we should snore oxytocin to become more compassionent 
but here's most people dont understand about oxytocin
it's a stress hormone

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE

### [09:00]

#### WHAT I WROTE

your poterhermonegallen pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response
it's as much part of your stress response as adrenaline that makes your heart pound
and when oxytocin has released in the stress response it's motivating you to seek support
your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up.
your stress response wants to make sure you know this when someone else in your life is strugling
so you can support each other.

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE




### [09:35]

#### WHAT I WROTE

when life is difficult
your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you
okay, so how knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
oxytocin doesnt only act on your brain
it also acts on your body
and one of it's main role in your body is to protect your cardio vascular system from the effects of stress

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [10:00]

#### WHAT I WROTE

it's a natrual inflammatory it also helps your blood veseles stay relaxed during stress
but my favorate effect on the body is actualy on the heart 
your heart has receptors for the hormone
and oxytocine helps heart cells regenarate and heal from any stress induced damage 
this stress hormone strengthen your heart 
and the cool thing is that all of this physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support


#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [10:30]

#### WHAT I WROTE

so when you reached out to others under stress either to sick support or to help someone else you release more of this hormone and your stress response becomes healthier and you actually recover faster from stress 
i found this amazing that your stress response that your stress response has bulit in mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is human connection

  

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [11:00]

#### WHAT I WROTE

i wanna finish by telling you about one more study
and listen up because this study also could save a life
this study tracked about a thousands adults in united states and they raged in age from 34 to 93 
and they started study by asking how much stress have you experinced in the last year ? 
they also asked about how much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people on your community ?
and then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died 
  

#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE


### [11:35]

#### WHAT I WROTE

okay, so the bad news first.
for every major stressful life experince like financial difficulties or family crisis that increase the risk of dying by 30 percent.
but
and i hope you are expecting a but 
i know
but that wasnt true for every one 
people who spent time caring for others 
showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying  (????) 

#### WHAI IT SHOULD BE




### [12:00]

#### WHAT I WROTE

caring creates resilience 
and so we see once again 
that the harmful effects of stress are not evadable
how you think and how you act can transform your experince of stress 
when you chose view your stress response as helpful 
you create biology of courage


#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE


### [12:30]

#### WHAT I WROTE

and when you choose to connect to others under stress 
you can create resilience 
now i wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experinces in my life 
but this science is giving me whole new preciation for stress 
stress gives us access to our hearts
the compassion of heart that finds joy and meaning and connecting with others 
and yes your pounding physical heart's working so hard to give you strength and energy



#### WHAT IT SHOULD BE



### [13:10]

#### WHAT I WROTE

and when you choose to view stress in this way
you are not just getting better at stress you actually making a pretty prefound statement 
you are saying that you can trust to your self to handle life challenges 
and you remembering that you have not to face them alone 
thank you 



ah this is kinda amazing what you're telling us 
this seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much diffrence to someone's life expecteacy
how that extends to advise like someone's making choise a stressful job and a non stressful job 
does it matter 
which way they go ?
it's equally wise to go for stressful job as long as you can believe you can handle it , make some sense?
yeah, one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health and trying avoid this comfort so i would say that the best way to make decisions is go after what is it creates meaning in your life and then trust your self to handle the stress it follows 
thank you so much
