for the last ten years is doing more hurm than good 
and it has to do with stress
for years i've been telling people stress makes you sick.
it increases the ~~risks~~ of everything from the ~~comming~~ cold to cardio ~~vascule~~ ~~diseass~~
~~basicly~~ i've ~~turn~~ stress into the enemy
but i've changed my mind about the stress
and today i wanna change yours

#### WHAT I WROTE

let me start with a study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress
this study tracked thirty thousands ~~adult~~  in united states for eight years
and ~~it~~ started by asking people how much stress ~~do~~ you ~~expreince~~ in the last year

they also asked do you believe that strees is harmful for your health
and then they used public death ~~record~~ to find out who died ?
